		<p><strong>Above all, do not lie to yourself.</strong>Above all, do not lie to yourself.  A man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point where he does not discern any truth either in himself or anywhere around him, and thus falls into disrespect towards himself and others.  Not respecting anyone, he ceases to love, and have no love, he give himself up to passions and coarse pleasures, in order to occupy and amuse himself, and in his vices reaches complete bestiality, and it all comes from lying continually to other and to himself.  A man who lies to himself is often the first to take offense.  It sometimes feels very good to take offense, doesnâ€™t it? And surely he knows that no one has offended him, and that he himself has invented the offense and told lies just for the beauty of it, and that he has exaggerated for the sake of effect, that he has picked on a word and made a mountain out of a pea-he knows all f that, and still he is the first to take offense, he likes feeling offended, it gives him great pleasure.  </p>
